<p>    A sandbox game is a video game with a gameplay element that provides players a great degree of creativity to interact with, 
    usually without any predetermined goal, or alternatively with a goal that the players set for themselves.
     Such games may lack any objective, and are sometimes referred to as non-games or software toys. 
    More often, sandbox games result from these creative elements being incorporated into other genres and allowing for emergent gameplay.
     Sandbox games are often associated with an open world concept which gives the players freedom of movement and progression in the game's world.
    The term "sandbox" derives from the nature of a sandbox that lets children create nearly anything they want within it.

        Early sandbox games came out of space trading and combat games like Elite (1984) and city-building simulations and tycoon games like SimCity (1989). 
    The releases of The Sims and Grand Theft Auto III in 2000 and 2001, respectively, demonstrated that games with highly detailed interacting systems that encouraged player experimentation could also be seen as sandbox games.
        Sandbox games also found ground with the ability to interact socially and share user-generated content across the Internet like Second Life (2003).
    More notable Sandbox games include Garry's Mod (2006), No Man's Sky (2016) and Dreams (2020), where players use the game's systems to create environments and modes to play with.
        Minecraft (2009) is one of the most successful examples of a sandbox game, with players able to enjoy both creative modes and more goal-driven survival modes.
         Roblox (2006) offers a chance for everyone to create their own game by using Roblox Lua programming language. It allows adding effects, setting up functions, testing your games, etc.
         Fortnite (2017) has gamemodes which allow players to either fight one another, fight off monsters or create their own battle arenas.

                From a video game development standpoint, a sandbox game is one that incorporates elements of sandbox design, a range of game systems that encourage free play.
            Sandbox design can either describe a game or a game mode, with an emphasis on free-form gameplay, relaxed rules, and minimal goals. Sandbox design can also describe a type of game development, where a designer slowly adds features to a minimal game experience, experimenting with each element one at a time.
            There are "a lot of varieties" of sandbox design, based on "a wide range of dynamic interactive elements". Thus, the term is used often, without a strict definition. Game designers sometimes define a sandbox as what it is not, where a game can "subtract the missions, the main campaign, the narrative or whatever formatively binds the game's progression, and you have a sandbox."
         <br>    
                In game design, a sandbox is a metaphor for playing in a literal sandbox.
                 Game historian Steve Breslin describes "the metaphor a child playing in a sandbox ... produc[ing] a world from sand", compared to games with more fully formed content.
                This metaphor between the virtual and literal sandbox is noted by architectural scholar Alexandra Lange, with a sandbox describing any bounded environment that offers freedom to explore and construct.
                 This can distinguish it from conventional ideas of a game, where the metaphorical sandbox is a "play space in which people can try on different roles and imaginary quests ... rather than a 'game' to play."
                    <br>
                In describing video games, sandbox design is often associated with the open world gameplay mechanic and vice versa, but these are two disparate concepts.
            Open worlds are those where the player's movement in the virtual world is typically not limited by the game allowing the player to roam freely through it. Adventure on the Atari 2600 is considered an open world game as the player can explore the entire game world save for through locked gates from the start, but it is not considered to have sandbox design as the player's actions are generally restricted.
                  Similarly, games like Microsoft Flight Simulator are also open world since the player can take their plane anywhere in the game's virtual world, but as there is no creative aspects to the game, would not be considered a sandbox.
