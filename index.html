                The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language.
                   Following several early private testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before being fully released in November 2011,
                with Notch stepping down and Jens "Jeb" Bergensten taking over development. Minecraft is the best-selling video game in history,
                with over 238 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active players as of 2021 and has been ported to several platforms.

                In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated, three-dimensional world with virtually infinite terrain and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks, and machines.
                 Depending on their chosen game mode, players can fight hostile mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. 
                 Game modes include a survival mode (in which players must acquire resources to build in the world and maintain health) and a creative mode (in which players have unlimited resources and access to flight).
                 There is also a wide variety of user-generated content, such as modifications, servers, skins, texture packs, and custom maps, which add new game mechanics and possibilities.
                     <br>
                Minecraft has received critical acclaim, winning several awards and later being cited as one of the greatest video games ever created. 
            Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual Minecon conventions played prominent roles in popularizing the game.
                 The game has also been used in educational environments to teach chemistry, computer-aided design, and computer science. In 2014, Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property were purchased by Microsoft for US$2.5 billion. 
            Several spin-offs have also been made, including Minecraft: Story Mode, Minecraft Dungeons, Minecraft Earth, and the upcoming Minecraft Legends.
             <h1>Gameplay</h1>
             <hr>
    
        Minecraft is a 3D sandbox game that has no required goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game.
    However, there is an achievement system,[18] known as "advancements" in the Java Edition of the game, and "trophies" on the PlayStation ports. Gameplay is in the first-person perspective by default, but players have the option of a third-person perspective.
        The game world is composed of rough 3D objects—mainly cubes and fluids, and commonly called "blocks"—representing various materials, such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and lava. The core gameplay revolves around picking up and placing these objects. 
    These blocks are arranged in a 3D grid, while players can move freely around the world. Players can "mine" blocks and then place them elsewhere, enabling them to build things. 
        Many commentators have described the game's physics system as unrealistic.[22] The game also contains a material called redstone, which can be used to make primitive mechanical devices, electrical circuits, and logic gates, allowing for the construction of many complex systems.
